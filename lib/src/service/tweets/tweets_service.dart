  ///             performed is passed to the callback function as
  ///             `PagingEvent` object. So you can get the result of paging
  ///             from `PagingEvent` object. Also, the direction and continuity
  ///             of paging can be controlled by returning
  ///             `PaginationControl` object in the `paging` callback function.
  ///             Please use `PaginationControl.forward()` to continue paging
  ///             and move forward, or use `PaginationControl.backward()`
  ///             to move backward. And be sure to return
  ///             `PaginationControl.stop()` to terminate paging on
  ///             arbitrary conditions, otherwise paging continues until the

  ///
  /// - [nextToken]: This parameter is used to get the next 'page' of results.

  ///
  /// - [sortOrder]: This parameter is used to specify the order in which you

  ///              default. If not specified, `endTime` will default to
  ///              [now - 30 seconds].
  ///
  /// - [sinceTweetId]: Returns results with a Tweet ID greater than (that is,
  ///                   more recent than) the specified ID. The ID specified is

  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  ///
  /// - [query]: One query for matching Tweets.
  ///            You can learn how to build this query by reading our build a
  ///            query guide. You can use all available operators and can make
  ///            queries up to 1,024 characters long.
  ///
  /// - [maxResults]: The maximum number of search results to be returned by a
  ///                 request. A number between 10 and the system limit
  ///                 (currently 500). By default, a request response will
  ///                 return 10 results.
  ///
  /// - [nextToken]: This parameter is used to get the next 'page' of results.
  ///                The value used with the parameter is pulled directly from
  ///                the response provided by the API, and should not be
  ///                modified. You can learn more by visiting our page on [pagination](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/paginate).
  ///
  /// - [sortOrder]: This parameter is used to specify the order in which you
  ///                want the Tweets returned. By default, a request will return
  ///                the most recent Tweets first (sorted by recency).
  ///
  /// - [startTime]: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). The oldest UTC
  ///                timestamp from which the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp
  ///                is in second granularity and is inclusive (for example,
  ///                12:00:01 includes the first second of the minute). By
  ///                default, a request will return Tweets from up to 30 days
  ///                ago if you do not include this parameter.
  ///
  /// - [endTime]: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). Used with
  ///              `startTime`. The newest, most recent UTC timestamp to which
  ///              the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp is in second
  ///              granularity and is exclusive (for example, 12:00:01 excludes
  ///              the first second of the minute). If used without `startTime`,
  ///              Tweets from 30 days before `endTime` will be returned by
  ///              default. If not specified, `endTime` will default to
  ///              [now - 30 seconds].
  ///
  /// - [sinceTweetId]: Returns results with a Tweet ID greater than (that is,
  ///                   more recent than) the specified ID. The ID specified is
  ///                   exclusive and responses will not include it. If included
  ///                   with the same request as a [startTime] parameter, only
  ///                   [sinceTweetId] will be used.
  ///
  /// - [untilTweetId]: Returns results with a Tweet ID less than (that is,
  ///                   older than) the specified ID. The ID specified is
  ///                   exclusive and responses will not include it.
  ///
  /// - [expansions]: Expansions enable you to request additional data objects
  ///                 that relate to the originally returned Tweets. Submit a
  ///                 list of desired expansions in a comma-separated list
  ///                 without spaces. The ID that represents the expanded data
  ///                 object will be included directly in the Tweet data object,
  ///                 but the expanded object metadata will be returned within

  ///
  /// The Tweets returned by this endpoint count towards the Project-level
  /// Tweet cap.
  ///
  /// The value returned when the [paging] callback is specified is

  /// function as a `PagingEvent` object.
  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  ///
  /// - [userId]: Unique identifier of the user for whom to return Tweets
  ///             mentioning the user. User ID can be referenced using

  ///
  /// - [maxResults]: Specifies the number of Tweets to try and retrieve, up to
  ///                 a maximum of 100 per distinct request. By default, 10
  ///                 results are returned if this parameter is not supplied.
  ///                 The minimum permitted value is 5. It is possible to
  ///                 receive less than the `max_results` per request throughout
  ///                 the pagination process.
  ///
  /// - [paginationToken]: This parameter is used to move forwards or backwards
  ///                      through 'pages' of results, based on the value of
  ///                      the `next_token` or `previous_token` in the response.
  ///                      The value used with the parameter is pulled directly
  ///                      from the response provided by the API, and should not

  ///                default, a request will return Tweets from up to 30 days
  ///                ago if you do not include this parameter.
  ///
  /// - [endTime]: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). Used with
  ///              `startTime`. The newest, most recent UTC timestamp to which

  ///              default. If not specified, `endTime` will default to
  ///              [now - 30 seconds].
  ///
  /// - [sinceTweetId]: Returns results with a Tweet ID greater than
  ///                   (that is, more recent than) the specified 'since'
  ///                   Tweet ID. There are limits to the number of Tweets that
  ///                   can be accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets
  ///                   has occurred since the [sinceTweetId], the

  ///
  /// - [untilTweetId]: Returns results with a Tweet ID less than
  ///                   (that is, older than) the specified 'until' Tweet ID.

  ///                  `expansions=geo.place_id` query parameter in your
  ///                  request. While the place ID will be located in the Tweet
  ///                  object, you will find this ID and all additional place
  ///                  fields in the `includes` data object.
  ///
  /// - [pollFields]: This fields parameter enables you to select which specific
  ///                 poll fields will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify
  ///                 the desired fields in a comma-separated list without
  ///                 spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only
  ///                 return poll fields if the Tweet contains a poll and if

  ///                 additional poll fields in the `includes` data object.
  ///
  /// - [mediaFields]: This fields parameter enables you to select which
  ///                  specific media fields will deliver in each returned
  ///                  Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated
  ///                  list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet
  ///                  will only return media fields if the Tweet contains media

  ///
  /// - [paging]: If this callback function is specified, paging is
  ///             performed continuously until certain conditions are met.

  ///             `PagingEvent` object. So you can get the result of paging
  ///             from `PagingEvent` object. Also, the direction and continuity
  ///             of paging can be controlled by returning
  ///             `PaginationControl` object in the `paging` callback function.
  ///             Please use `PaginationControl.forward()` to continue paging
  ///             and move forward, or use `PaginationControl.backward()`

  ///
  /// The value returned when the [paging] callback is specified is
  /// the first object obtained that started the paging process. The value
  /// obtained in the paging process is passed to the [paging] callback
  /// function as a `PagingEvent` object.
  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  ///
  /// - [userId]: Unique identifier of the user that is requesting their
  ///             chronological home timeline. User ID can be referenced using
  ///             the user/lookup endpoint. More information on Twitter IDs is
  ///             [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-ids).
  ///
  /// - [maxResults]: Specifies the number of Tweets to try and retrieve, up to
  ///                 a maximum of 100 per distinct request. By default,
  ///                100 results are returned if this parameter is not supplied.
  ///                The minimum permitted value is 1. It is possible to receive
  ///                less than the `max_results` per request throughout the
  ///                pagination process.
  ///
  /// - [paginationToken]: This parameter is used to move forwards or backwards
  ///                      through 'pages' of results, based on the value of the
  ///                      next_token or previous_token in the response. The
  ///                      value used with the parameter is pulled directly from
  ///                      the response provided by the API, and should not be
  ///                      modified.
  ///
  /// - [startTime]: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). The oldest UTC
  ///                timestamp from which the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp
  ///                is in second granularity and is inclusive (for example,
  ///                12:00:01 includes the first second of the minute). By
  ///                default, a request will return Tweets from up to 30 days
  ///                ago if you do not include this parameter.
  ///
  /// - [endTime]: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). Used with
  ///              `startTime`. The newest, most recent UTC timestamp to which
  ///              the Tweets will be provided. Timestamp is in second
  ///              granularity and is exclusive (for example, 12:00:01 excludes
  ///              the first second of the minute). If used without `startTime`,
  ///              Tweets from 30 days before `endTime` will be returned by
  ///              default. If not specified, `endTime` will default to
  ///              [now - 30 seconds].
  ///
  /// - [sinceTweetId]: Returns results with a Tweet ID greater than
  ///                   (that is, more recent than) the specified 'since'
  ///                  Tweet ID. There are limits to the number of Tweets that
  ///                  can be accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets
  ///                  has occurred since the [sinceTweetId], the [sinceTweetId]
  ///                  will be forced to the oldest ID available.
  ///
  /// - [untilTweetId]: Returns results with a Tweet ID less than
  ///                   (that is, older than) the specified 'until' Tweet ID.
  ///                   There are limits to the number of Tweets that can be
  ///                   accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets has
  ///                   occurred since the [untilTweetId], the [untilTweetId]
  ///                   will be forced to the most recent ID available.
  ///
  /// - [excludes]: The list of the types of Tweets to exclude from the
  ///               response.
  ///
  /// - [expansions]: Expansions enable you to request additional data objects
  ///                 that relate to the originally returned Tweets. Submit a
  ///                 list of desired expansions in a comma-separated list
  ///                 without spaces. The ID that represents the expanded data
  ///                 object will be included directly in the Tweet data object,
  ///                 but the expanded object metadata will be returned within
  ///                 the includes response object, and will also include the ID
  ///                 so that you can match this data object to the original
  ///                 Tweet object.
  ///
  /// - [tweetFields]: This fields parameter enables you to select which
  ///                  specific Tweet fields will deliver in each returned Tweet
  ///                  object. You can also pass `expansions` to return the
  ///                  specified fields for both the original Tweet and any
  ///                  included referenced Tweets. The requested Tweet fields
  ///                  will display in both the original Tweet data object, as
  ///                  well as in the referenced Tweet expanded data object that
  ///                  will be located in the `includes` data object.
  ///
  /// - [userFields]: This fields parameter enables you to select which specific
  ///                 user fields will deliver in each returned Tweet. While the
  ///                 user ID will be located in the original Tweet object, you
  ///                 will find this ID and all additional user fields in the
  ///                 `includes` data object.
  ///
  /// - [placeFields]: This fields parameter enables you to select which
  ///                  specific place fields will deliver in each returned
  ///                  Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated
  ///                  list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet
  ///                  will only return place fields if the Tweet contains a
  ///                  place and if you’ve also included the
  ///                  `expansions=geo.place_id` query parameter in your
  ///                  request. While the place ID will be located in the Tweet
  ///                  object, you will find this ID and all additional place
  ///                  fields in the `includes` data object.
  ///
  /// - [pollFields]: This fields parameter enables you to select which specific
  ///                 poll fields will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify
  ///                 the desired fields in a comma-separated list without
  ///                 spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only
  ///                 return poll fields if the Tweet contains a poll and if
  ///                 you've also included the `expansions=attachments.poll_ids`
  ///                 query parameter in your request. While the poll ID will be
  ///                 located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all
  ///                 additional poll fields in the `includes` data object.
  ///
  /// - [mediaFields]: This fields parameter enables you to select which
  ///                  specific media fields will deliver in each returned
  ///                  Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated
  ///                  list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet
  ///                  will only return media fields if the Tweet contains media
  ///                  and if you've also included the
  ///                  `expansions=attachments.media_keys` query parameter in
  ///                  your request. While the media ID will be located in the
  ///                  Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional
  ///                  media fields in the `includes` data object.
  ///
  /// - [paging]: If this callback function is specified, paging is
  ///             performed continuously until certain conditions are met.
  ///             This paging function is bi-directional,
  ///             both forward and backward, and allows for safe paging.
  ///             The response and other metadata obtained when paging is
  ///             performed is passed to the callback function as
  ///             `PagingEvent` object. So you can get the result of paging
  ///             from `PagingEvent` object. Also, the direction and continuity
  ///             of paging can be controlled by returning
  ///             `PaginationControl` object in the `paging` callback function.
  ///             Please use `PaginationControl.forward()` to continue paging
  ///             and move forward, or use `PaginationControl.backward()`
  ///             to move backward. And be sure to return
  ///             `PaginationControl.stop()` to terminate paging on
  ///             arbitrary conditions, otherwise paging continues until the
  ///             next page runs out.

  ///                      parameter.
  ///
  ///                      This feature will deliver all Tweets that matched
  ///                      your rules and were published during the time frame
  ///                      selected, meaning that if you were disconnected for
  ///                      90 seconds, and you requested two minutes of
  ///                      backfill, you will receive 30 seconds worth of
  ///                      duplicate Tweets. Due to this, you should make sure
  ///                      your system is tolerant of duplicate data.
  ///
  ///                      This feature is currently only available to users
